Items on the list shall have a prefix that indicate nature of a change. Prefixes are:

\+ something new was added  
\- something existing was removed  
\~ something existing was changed  
\! indicate a known issue that must be kept in mind during future development  
\!! indicate a known issue that must be resolved ASAP  
\# a known issue was closed (indicating issue ID would be preferable)
